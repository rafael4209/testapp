# testapp

hey, since the focus of the task was system design, i left room for:
1. validation(extremely important because we have mongo)
2. logging & monitoring
3. caching (not sure if its required with the questionnaire case)
4. add multiple questionnaire-campaign support
5. add multiple users support
6. add authentication (or some other way of identifying users) and pull user id from there
7. cleanup
8. comments
9. dockerfile + prometheus agent
10. retrieve select options from backend
11. adapt to object-options

12 most important- current implementation uses growing arrays, have to reverse it by host id?

13. fix endpoint names
